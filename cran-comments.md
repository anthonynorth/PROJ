# PROJ 0.3.1

PROJ now leverages libproj and so all configure and file-copy requirements have been removed. 

This addresses a request from CRAN to configure correctly for MacOS static builds and for metadata
files (email from the 16 June). 

Thank you. 

## Test environments

* local R installation, R 4.0.2
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 notes
